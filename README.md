## ⚙️ Tech Stack (It’s All The Cool Kids Are Using)

| Layer     | Tech      | Notes                                      |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | Next.js   | Because who needs "classic" React anymore? |
| Backend   | FastAPI   | Fast, like your Wi-Fi when no one else is home |
| DB        | MongoDB   | NoSQL, because SQL is for slowpokes     |
| Auth      | TBD       | Local auth or Firebase — who needs to decide yet? |
| Media     | TBD       | Firebase, Local Storage, or maybe just send them in an email? |

## 🚧 Current Progress

- **Frontend:** The login page (HTML) is looking *beautiful*, just missing a sprinkle of sparkle ✨. _No progress n NextJS_
- **Backend:** Authentication (JWT tokens, baby!) is just started. Need to add some *sauce* (validation, hashing, mongo connection, etc.).
- **Database:** MongoDB is set up, no data stored yet though. Feel free to test it with your schema.
