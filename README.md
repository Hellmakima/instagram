# InstaClone

A full-stack simulacrum of Instagram, forged with affection, driven by **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, and **Next.js**.  
’Tis modular, unsoiled, and as vast as thy hoard of mirthful images.

_*This scroll hath been conjured by the mighty hand of GPT. I beg pardon for any follies or errours thou mayst uncover. If a gremlin be found, mayhap it be mine doing… or mayhap not… yet I vow to mend it, upon my honour.*_

| Sphere   | Alchemy       | Scribblings                                                      |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forepart | Next.js       | Forsooth, who now doth favour "classic" React?                   |
| Rearward | FastAPI       | As swift as thine Wi-Fi, when none doth leech it                 |
| Tome     | MongoDB       | NoSQL — for those who deem SQL a sluggish beast                  |
| Warding  | To Be Decreed | Mayhap Firebase, mayhap Local — 'tis a mystery yet               |
| Imagery  | Unchosen      | Perchance Firebase, or stored local — or sent by carrier pigeon? |

## The State of Affairs

- **In Sum:** ‘Tis barren.
- **Forepart:** Only humble scrolls of static HTML hath been penned for trial and jest.
- **Rearward:** A modest conjuration; the mage yet studies and doth experiment.
- **Tome:** MongoDB hath been summoned… and then the mage grew weary.
