# 🪞 InstaClone

A full-stack simulacrum of Instagram, forged with affection, driven by **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, and **Next.js**.  
’Tis modular, unsoiled, and as vast as thy hoard of mirthful images.

_*This scroll hath been conjured by the mighty hand of GPT. I beg pardon for any follies or errours thou mayst uncover. If a gremlin be found, mayhap it be mine doing… or mayhap not… yet I vow to mend it, upon my honour.*_

## ⚙️ The Arcane Implements (What the Youth of Yore Might Call “Trendy”)

| Sphere   | Alchemy       | Scribblings                                        |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Forepart | Next.js       | Forsooth, who now doth favour "classic" React?     |
| Rearward | FastAPI       | As swift as thine Wi-Fi, when none doth leech it   |
| Tome     | MongoDB       | NoSQL — for those who deem SQL a sluggish beast    |
| Warding  | To Be Decreed | Mayhap Firebase, mayhap Local — 'tis a mystery yet |

## The State of Affairs

- **In Sum:** ‘Tis barren.
- **Forepart:** Only humble scrolls of static HTML hath been penned for trial and jest.
- **Rearward:** A modest conjuration; the mage yet studies and doth experiment.
- **Tome:** MongoDB hath been summoned… and then the mage grew weary.

## 🧙‍♂️ How to Summon This Beast (Getting Started)

1. **Clone the Grimoire**  
   `git clone https://github.com/hellmakima/instaclone.git`

2. **Conjure a Virtual Realm**  
   `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`  
   _(or `venv\Scripts\activate` if thou rideth Windows)_

3. **Scribe the Runes (Install Deps)**  
   `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`

4. **Kindle the Backfire (Run Backend)**  
   `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 5000`  
   Then venture to: [localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs#/)  
   There shalt thou behold the holy scroll of endpoints.

5. **Craft the Forepart (Next.js Frontend)**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Seek [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the mirror realm awaits.

## 🛡️ Warding (Security & Auth)

In days yet to come, the wards shall be woven. Here's the prophecy:

- **Local Auth** – Thy own runes of login, hashed with bcrypt and stored with care.
- **JWT Tokens** – Each bearer shall prove their claim, or be smote by 401s.

For now?
**None but trust and jest keep the gates.**
