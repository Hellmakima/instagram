**You don't _strictly_ need an `endpoints` folder from a purely technical Python or FastAPI execution standpoint.** FastAPI will happily find and include your `APIRouter` instances whether they are directly under `api_v1/` or nested within an `endpoints/` sub-directory.

Recommended to keep the `endpoints/` folder for the following reasons related to **clarity, maintainability, future-proofing, and separation of concerns**:

1. **Semantic Grouping and Clarity:**

    - The `api_v1/` folder represents a **version namespace** (e.g., all code related to API Version 1).
    - The `endpoints/` folder explicitly clarifies that the contents within it are **HTTP API route definitions**.
    - This distinction helps new developers (or your future self) immediately understand the _purpose_ of the files and folders inside `api_v1/`.

2. **Future Expansion and Separation of Concerns within a Version:**
    Your `api_v1/` directory might eventually contain more than just endpoint definitions. For example, you might have:

    - `api_v1/schemas/` (for Pydantic models/data contracts)
    - `api_v1/dependencies/` (for common, reusable FastAPI dependencies like database sessions, current user, etc., which might be shared across multiple modules)
    - `api_v1/services/` (for business logic that your endpoints call)
    - `api_v1/crud/` (for database interaction logic)
    - `api_v1/config/` (version-specific configuration)
    - `api_v1/middleware/` (custom middleware for this API version)

    If you put all your `auth/`, `password/`, `security/` etc., folders directly into `api_v1/`, then `api_v1/` would become a flat list containing both endpoint definitions _and_ these other concerns.

    **Example of a more complex `api_v1` without `endpoints/` (less clear):**

    ```ini
    api_v1/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── auth/                 # Endpoints
    ├── password/             # Endpoints
    ├── router.py             # Main API Router
    ├── schemas/              # Pydantic models
    ├── dependencies.py       # Shared dependencies
    └── services/             # Business logic
    ```

    **Example with `endpoints/` (more organized):**

    ```ini
    api_v1/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── endpoints/            # Contains all API endpoints
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── auth/
    │   ├── password/
    │   └── ...
    ├── router.py             # Main API Router (includes endpoints/routers)
    ├── schemas/              # Pydantic models
    ├── dependencies.py       # Shared dependencies
    └── services/             # Business logic
    ```

    The second structure clearly delineates what's an endpoint module versus what's a schema module or a service module.

3. **Consistency Across API Versions:**
    If you later introduce `api_v2/`, maintaining a consistent structure like `api_vX/endpoints/` helps in understanding and navigating between different API versions.

4. **Team Collaboration:**
    In a team environment, having clear, agreed-upon structural conventions helps developers quickly locate code and reduces cognitive load, especially as the project grows.
