"""
Folder: app/schemas/

this folder holds files that describe JSON Structures for frontend requests.

## **Only put fields that user will send to frontend here.**

if you have a field called `is_verified` for your user, you shouldn't put it here because it's not a frontend field.
Instead, put it in a service to format it e.g., `app/services/to_doc.py`
